# privacy-and-security-workaround

## network
tor browser - allows you to access the main internet, securely. should get around restrictions, if not try using a bridge
onionshare - tor but for chat and file transfer
i2p - allows for private peer-2-peer transfer of info to other people with i2p. cannot access the main internet

## other security
KeePassCX - good password manager

## VPNs
proton seems to work the best. is a private product with a fairly good free version
riseup is run by some anarchists. probably more secure but less useful for most people
